% Players are now approaching the Palace of the High Sorcerers of Biskalane.
% The Demon patrons of Witchery have hinted that time and space are elements in their own right.
% Here, time is out of joint, and players will see a vision of the Eve of Destruction.

% On that night, the High Sorcerers attempted to gain immortality,
% but instead caused the Diffraction that has cursed the land ever since.
