DesertBridge is DesertRoom

% In all that remains of the once mighty Temple of Hristofalnakan,
% (it's a mouthful, the NPCs know) the Essence of Lightning has taken up
% residence on the sacred altar. It protects this area and Waylay Oasis
% from the effects of the other prisms, and offers its own protections
% and boosts in the form of &ShockStorm. Using the Essence of Lightning will
% transport an adventurer to the Prism of Lightning, an otherworldly plane
% that exists purely in the sky. However, an unknown great hero has already
% gone ahead and defeated the Avatar of Lightning - thus the presnce of the
% Essence here in the first place. Travel through the Prism of Lightning
% can land an adventurer on the next island over. Some dangers remain within,
% but the Avatar of Lightning is apparently dead for all time. How this was
% accomplished, none know.

% Use of the Essence of Lightning flags an adventurer for the ability to learn
% Lightning Strike (the behind-teleportation lightning + hammer attack).

% This area always has &ShockStorm.
% This area never has other weather effects.
