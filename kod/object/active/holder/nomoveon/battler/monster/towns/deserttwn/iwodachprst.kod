      "immortal and unafraid behind his eyes."

   iwodach_hello_response = \
      "Hail and well met, fellow human."

   iwodach_desert_response = \
      "How about this weather, eh friend?"
   iwodach_biskalane_response = \
      "It is quite the shame that our fellow humans had their empire reduced to sand."
   iwodach_tales_response = \
      "Oh, I've done little of interest, friend."
   iwodach_diffraction_response = \
      "It is important that we humans learn as much as we can about the disaster so that "

      "Thus, I also hold that sentiment. Do you also think the High Sorcerers are bad? "
      "What would you rate them on a scale from one to ten? Wait, no, don't tell me. "
      "That's too specific."

   iwodach_random_7 = \
      "On a scale from one to ten, how do you enjoy the concept of numbers? "
      "Please answer without using them."
   
   iwodach_prism_of_fire_response = \
