      "This man is younger than the others in this small tribe, but he is still "
      "hardly youthful. His natural suspicion and shifting stance give hints as "
      "to his true occupation."

   kerrenor_hello_response = \
      "Yes?"

   kerrenor_desert_response = \
      "The desert is full of life. One just has to know where to look."
   kerrenor_biskalane_response = \
      "The past is irrelevant. Biskalane is never coming back."
   kerrenor_tales_response = \
      "Heh. If I told you, then you'd just become an accomplice."
   kerrenor_diffraction_response = \
      "Learning the phases of elemental danger is crucial to survival."
   kerrenor_elements_response = \
      "Wear a helmet when it rains acid. Wear robes when it is cold. Take off "
      "your body armor when the heat burns down upon you. These rules will keep you alive."
   kerrenor_vecka_response = \
      "Vrinna was the coldest mother I've ever seen, and believe me, I've seen some terrible parenting."

   kerrenor_wastes_response = \
      "I have never seen anyone I supposedly send to the Eternal Wastes come back to seek revenge. Thus, "
      "I do not believe in this Xaerdun nor do I believe in his deals for resurrection."
   kerrenor_sorcerers_response = \
      "Immortality is a laughable idea in a land where death is beyond every dune."

   kerrenor_xaerdun_response = \
      "They say he offers mortals a way back from the Eternal Wastes in exchange for something "
      "valuable. I wouldn't know."
   kerrenor_iwodach_response = \

   kerrenor_nequzon_response = \
      "Her witches are as crazy as they are ugly. Don't drink any of their potions, or you'll end up "
      "regretting it. It's the only way they can manage to get any man to have children with them."
   kerrenor_raumlar_response = \

   kerrenor_random_2 = \

      "have killed even the deepest hibernating seeds."
   kerrenor_random_3 = \
      "Don't get caught alone by bandits."
   kerrenor_random_4 = \

      "but the dishonorable get to live."
   kerrenor_random_6 = \
      "Daggers may be small, but they're very light. If you know some warrior skills, "
      "you can parry far more effectively with a dagger than with other weapons."
   kerrenor_random_7 = \
      "If you can sneak up to a target unseen, try to open every fight with a devastating "
