      "Lines show on this woman's face at certain angles, as if some sort of magical "
      "pact is struggling to keep her young. She watches you with peaceful eyes "
      "that mask regret."

   vrinna_hello_response = \
      "Greetings. How fare the elements for you today?"

   vrinna_desert_response = \
      "It is what it is. We are not wealthy or well-fed, but we are alive."
   vrinna_biskalane_response = \
      "I remember. Oh, I remember..."
   vrinna_tales_response = \
      "Tales matter no longer, only actions."
   vrinna_diffraction_response = \
      "The elements are unbalanced, and this land will remain forever ravaged until "
      "all of the elemental Prisms are sealed at the same time."
   vrinna_elements_response = \
      "Ah, the bane of this land. You must stay prepared at all times."
   vrinna_vecka_response = \
      "Her father began to lose his mind when she died. It was as if he simply gave up. "
      "I should have been kinder to both of them..."

   vrinna_wastes_response = \
      "I have been back and forth from the Eternal Wastes many times. It is necessary to "
      "travel there for certain pacts and alliances. Skilled witches often come back from "
      "death stronger."
   vrinna_sorcerers_response = \
      "The poor fools. Immortality is a curse, not a prize to be sought."
   
   vrinna_sorcerer_response = \
      "Please be kind to him."
   vrinna_witch_response = \
      "You cannot call upon my name like you might that of a demon."
   vrinna_bandit_response = \
      "I might have taken him for a lover if he contained an iota of trustworthiness."

   vrinna_ventdal_response = \
      "I serve my mistress with absolute loyalty. It is her protection, combined with "
      "this position of natural balance between the conflicting Prisms, that allows our small "
      "tribe to survive in one place. All others are forced to be nomadic."
   vrinna_xaerdun_response = \
      "Greedy and pathetic! If you make a pact with him, I shall teach you nothing."
   vrinna_iwodach_response = \
      "I appreciate his inclination toward both higher and lower learning, even if I "
      "find his followers to be a bit boring."
   vrinna_nequzon_response = \
      "There's a certain power in her mania. Certainly, no other demon dares test "
      "her limits. Why anger one who might expend all of her powers against you simply "
      "out of spite? It is her lack of intelligent planning that paradoxically makes her so dangerous."
   vrinna_raumlar_response = \
      "He is misunderstood. His tortures are simply a byproduct of his desire to "
      "learn the ins and outs of your pleasure and pain responses. One day he may even come to "
      "realize that we are creatures of sentience and free will. For now, I suggest you avoid him "
      "at all costs."

   vrinna_sorcery_response = \

   vrinna_witchery_response = \

      "with our hated opposite, Xaerdun."
   vrinna_banditry_response = \
      "The young and good-looking one is friends with many men of ill repute."

   vrinna_jala_response = \
      "What exactly is a goddess? Is it like a demon, but without the selfish component that so "
      "defines their kind?"
   vrinna_bard_response = \
      "Sapsis, the demon of misery, once graced our camp after an enemy tribe asked him to visit "
      "plagues upon us. Lucius drove Sapsis away by being even more miserable than he. In some ways, "
      "that depressed bard has kept us far safer than any magic."

   vrinna_random_1 = \
      "Nequzon and Iwodach are bitter rivals. Neither will say why, but I believe it comes down "
      "to a fundamental difference in beliefs about power. Nequzon believes power comes from "
      "mastery of empirical results. Iwodach believes power stems from understanding the equations "
      "behind physical results. The difference may be minor to you and me, but it is everything to"
      "the entities that we call demons."
   vrinna_random_2 = \
      "Ventdal and Xaerdun do not share followers. This rift I understand, for Ventdal seeks "
      "to foster the survival and growth of witches, while Xaerdun cares for naught but wealth."
   vrinna_random_3 = \
      "I can still feel the magics of the six High Sorcerers that caused the Diffraction. "
      "Are they alive in their distant fortress? I wonder..."
   vrinna_random_4 = \
      "Korath is a good man. He deserved a better life than what he lived. He deserved "
      "a complete family."
   vrinna_random_5 = \
      "I am not immortal, but my pact with Ventdal has greatly extended my lifespan. "
      "Many of the nomadic witches are my descendants, for I took a new family every decade "
      "or so."
   vrinna_random_6 = \
      "Biskalane was a civilization beyond compare. Believe me when I say that the realms "
      "of man lost something precious that day."
   vrinna_random_7 = \
      "It was a clear summer day, beautiful and warm, when the sky began to burn. Acid rained "
      "down, blizzards raged despite the heat, and arcing lightning destroyed all "
      "metal-based technology in mere hours. But the true extent of the damage was known "
      "only to those that died after that day: the elemental forces we call holy and unholy "
      "were also diffracted. This was the key to the High Sorcerers' failed plan. Life and Death "
      "have been broken, leaving only grey Eternal Wastes between. We are doomed in this world "
      "and the next."
