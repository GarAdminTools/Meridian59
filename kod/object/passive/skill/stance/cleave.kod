Cleave is Stance

   % This stance modifies basic attacks.
   % A Weaponcraft 5 player in this stance will attempt to deal melee damage
   %    to multiple nearby enemies when attacking their target.
   %
   % Cleave works with fencing weapons, riija swords, axes, and scimitars.
   % Regardless of the weapon used, the damage type becomes slashing.
