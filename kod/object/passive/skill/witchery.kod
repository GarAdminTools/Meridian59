WitcherySkill is Skill

% Witchery is Meridian's first hybrid spell-and-skill school.
%
% Witchery contains a variety of spells called Hexes.
% These are curses that debilitate an opponent.
% Generally, any given victim can only have one Hex applied at a time.
% Casting another on them removes the first.
%
% Witchery also contains skills that can do things like boost Hex duration,
% Hex effectiveness, resistance to Hexes, and even allow the casting of
% a second Hex on a victim at a blood cost.
%
% Witchery is also Meridian's first school containing subschools.
% There are four demons players can learn from, and one (Raumlar) that only NPCs can use.
% These demons do not necessarily like eachother.
% A player may choose either Xaerdun or Ventdal.
% A player may also choose either Iwodach or Nequzon.
% 
% These subschool choices mean that a given witchery character can be:
% Xaerdun/Iwodach
% Xaerdun/Nequzon
% Ventdal/Iwodach
% Ventdal/Nequzon
%
% So it's entirely possible for two characters to both have Witchery but share no abilities at all.
% This is a crucial part of the lore feeling of Witches and Warlocks that hold grudges and have feuds.
