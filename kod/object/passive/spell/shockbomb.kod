      "Silently lays a prepared bag of magically-enhanced electrochemical catalysts. "
      "On their journey to mastery of the alchemical talents, "
      "alchemists often discover the many and varied uses of electricity. "
      "The first thing most do, of course, is create a new type of bomb. "
      "When laid, a lightning bomb is harmless until the alchemist casts 'detonate bombs.' "
      "Once that is done, the triggered explosion will cause everything "
      "nearby to become electrocuted, and some patches of ground will become imbued with electrical charge. "
      "The explosion itself is also "
      "bright enough to dazzle victims for a time. "
      "\n\nThe bag and the elements for the bomb are transmuted "
      "directly from gold, so only shillings are required."
      "\n\nOnly a certain number of bombs can be magically controlled "
      "at once. Any above this limit are designed to harmlessly defuse, "
      "so that no innocents wander past and get harmed."
